# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
n this project we have used UCI Bank Marketing dataset, which is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese baking institution. The classification goal is predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable 'y'). 
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
n this project, we have used scikit-learn Logistic Regression and tuned the hyperparameters(optimal) using HyperDrive. We also used AutoML to build and optimize a model on the same dataset, so that we can compare the results of the two methods. The best performing model was obtained through AutoML - VotingEnsemble with accuracy of 0.9177
## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
